vcsdo -- Uniform commands for git, svn, hg repositories

vcs are a nice inventions but unfortunately even the most trivial tasks 
are achieved in different ways depending on which vcs you use. This ruby 
script tries to facilitate updating local copies of different vcs.

vcsdo does not aim at being a grand unified ui. It supports only simple 
tasks.


Examples:

Update the current directory:
vcsdo update

Update all directories below a common root directory:
vcsdo --each ..../myLocalCopies update


See "vcsdo --help" for a list of supported commands. Some commands are 
not supported for certain vcs types.


Dependency: ruby 1.8
